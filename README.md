## Data

Box Office Mojo (BOM) is a webside run by IMDB that reports and organizes box office receipts from Movies. The essential data being pulled from this source is a Domestic and Foreign Gross for correspoding movies identified by a title. 

IMDB is a webside containing extensive details about individual movies. The datasets contain information like titles, year released, runtime, production, persons involed (actors, diretors, etc), and importantly, review data associated with each movie. 

We are given access to more sets of data, but for simplicity and consistency, this analysis will focus on a dataset created from the combination of these two sources.
