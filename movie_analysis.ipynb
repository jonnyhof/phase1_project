    "\n",
    "This project explores movie data from IMDB and Box Office Mojo to generate business insights for a new movie studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft has decided to enter the movie production industry and create a new movie studio, but they want some advice. This project asks and analyzes which types of films are doing best at the box office, and the results will inform decisions and actions Microsoft's studio can take to create successful production company and films.\n",

    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Box Office Mojo (BOM) is a webside run by IMDB that reports and organizes box office receipts from Movies. The essential data being pulled from this source is a Domestic and Foreign Gross for correspoding movies identified by a title. \n",
    "\n",
    "IMDB is a webside containing extensive details about individual movies. The datasets contain information like titles, year released, runtime, production, persons involed (actors, diretors, etc), and importantly, review data associated with each movie. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are given access to more sets of data, but for simplicity and consistency, this analysis will focus on a dataset created from the combination of these two sources."

In the future I would do this in the opposite order. For example, first joining the imdb_basics and imdb_ratings would cut the size of our data in half, which in turn would reduce the Fuzzy matching runtime by about half. Given this still takes a while to re-run, and I have already saved the new .csv matching file, I will just continue to clean the data from here. We will end up with the same data in the end, but be aware this could have been done in a different order to improve efficiency. "

    "I am also doing this before the BOM megre because that merge will decrease our dataset to only 3000 rows. I may also be interested in exploring the ratings of all IMDB moives without the BOM gross data. So first create a merged set of Basics and Ratings that inlcudes rating and genre information for 70k movies. Then this Dataframe is what I will join with the BOM fuzzy matches. This allows for slightly more flexibility in the size of the dataset while doing analysis and exploration. "

Most of these are real duplicates but most likely we are also losing a few movies that were released multiple times and have different gross and rating data for each.
